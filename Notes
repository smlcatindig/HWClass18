Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviours/ methods of a parent class.
The idea behind inheritance is that you can create a new classes that are built upon existing classes.
We reuse the methods and fields of parent class, and we can also add new methods and fields too.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as parent-child relationship.

extends is the keyword we use.

Syntax:
class Subclass-Name extends Superclass-Name{
// methods and fields
}

3 Types of Inheritance:
Single inheritance
=> single base class and single derived class (one parent and one child)

Multilevel inheritance
=> there exists a single base class, single derived class and multiple intermediate base classes

Hierarchical inheritance
=> when a class has a more than one child classes(sub classes) have the same parent



Task1:
create 3 classes Audi, BMW and Tesla create 4 fields and 2 methods in each class.

Task2:
write a multilevel inheritance where class C inherits from class B and class B inherits from Class A

Task3:
Write a program to inherit class A that has method printF which is static and call or reuse that method into class B
